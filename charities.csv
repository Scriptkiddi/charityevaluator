	Spark inside	24		£118,352	£4,931.33		Number of beneficiaries given towards the end of p2. May be somewhat inflated as the charity is still fairly new, although I think coaching is fundamentally quite pricey. Furthermore, I believe that the coachees are just those who are most willing and engaged, which means that they may have been quite likely to avoid recidivism themselves anyway	http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends20/0001148420_AC_20140331_E_C.pdf	YTFN or Filanthropy*

	Project healthy children				£0.05		I can't find the figures from PHC themselves, however GWWC has some info on this - "Even for relatively small populations, this comes to between $0.05 and $0.10 per person" https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/project-healthy-children "The cost of providing all of this advice to a country is in the order of $300-$650,000 which could lead to an annual cost per person in the country under one cent" https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/reports/PHC%20Report.pdf

	Strong Minds	514		£104,202	£202.73		This is based on the 2013 figures, which is the year when strong minds was set up (hence the cost figure which is based only on the period from 19th Feb). I couldn't find a number of beneficiaries. There were two impact reports, both of which referred to treating 500 women, however I don't think that was total number of beneficiaries reached, I think that was just the amount considered for the purposes of the impact report	http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/46-2090059/strongminds.aspx#financials	Impact report is interesting, but doesn't provide any insight on cost effectiveness http://strongminds.org/our-impact/			2/19/2013	12/31/2013

	Make a wish UK	997		£6,400,442	£6,419.70		Of the 997, 893 are wishes granted to a seriously ill child, and 104 are "wish assists". I'm not sure what that means, but I think it's when a child abroad wishes to visit the UK, and the UK entity helps make that happen. I have not included the 101 cases where preparations started by the wish "sadly had to be cancelled" (presumably the child died?) Arguably this is not giving enough credit, since the family and child presumably benefitted from knowing that things were being done for them, even if they didn't get the actual wish in the end.	http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends72/0000295672_AC_20131231_E_C.pdf
